MENDOZA, LOUIS ADRIAN F.

Final Case Study: Network Automation

In this case study, I’m going to create a network topology for a school using GNS3. I would also be going to use Ansible 
for network automation. The school wants to have three networks for the computer lab, school office and for 
the management. 

#### The three network topics that I tackle on the network automation are the following:
<ul>
  <li>Configuration of DHCP pools for the 4 networks</li>
  <li>Configuration of OSPF in the routers</li>
  <li>Application of Extended ACL for the network.</li>
</ul>
