# FINAL-CASE-STUDY
Final Case Study: Network Automation

In this lab, I’m going to create a network topology for a school using GNS3. I would also be going to use Ansible 
for network automation. The school wants to have three networks for the computer lab, school office and for 
the management. 

#### The three network topics that I tackle on the network automation are the following:
• Configuration of DHCP pools for the 4 networks
• Configuration of OSPF in the routers
• Application of Extended ACL for the network.
